1.- [2.5 points] We use a list like [ [1,4],[4,3],[3,2],[2,1] ] to

represent a directed graph with edges 1-->4, 4-->3, etc.  Write a

predicate path(G,N1,N2) that, given a graph G and nodes N1 and N2 of

G, is satisfied if there is a (directed) path in G from N1 to N2.

Example:

?- path([[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[1,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,4],[4,6]],1,6).

true.

?- path([[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[1,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,4],[4,6]],5,1).

false.

Hint: the follow program pattern can be completed to obtain a valid

solution. The built-in predicate select (pert_con_resto) means "X is a

member of the list L, and R is the list of remaining elements of L".

path( ,  ,  ):- !.

path( ,  ,  ):- select( , , ), path( , , ),!.

2.- [2.5 points] In 2-SAT, a clause like \+3 v 4 can be seen as two

different implications: 3 --> 4 and \+4 --> \+3.

Using this idea, from a set of two-literal clauses S, we can create a

directed graph G: for each clause lit1 v lit2 of S, the graph G gets

the two edges \+lit1 --> lit2 and \+lit2 --> lit1.

It is well known that then S is satisfiable iff there is no cycle in G

containing some variable x and its negation \+x (i.e. a path from x to

\+x and another path from \+x to x)

2-SAT: Given a set of two-literal clauses S with variables numbered

1..N, represented by a list such as [ [\+3,4],[8,\+2],...] to indicate

clauses \+3 v 4, 8 v \+2, ... write a predicate sat(N,S) that tells us

whether S is satisfiable.

Example:

?- sat(6,[[\+1,2],[\+2,3],[\+4,\+6],[\+2,\+4],[4,5],[\+6,1],[\+5,\+2],[2,1]]).

false.

?- sat(6,[[\+1,2],[\+2,3],[\+4,\+6],[4,5],[\+6,1],[\+5,\+2],[2,1]]).

true.

Hint:  The follow program pattern can be completed

to obtain a valid solution.
